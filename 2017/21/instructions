--- Day 21: Fractal Art ---
You find a program trying to generate some art. It uses a strange process that involves repeatedly enhancing the detail of an image through a set of rules.

The image consists of a two-dimensional square grid of pixels that are either on (#) or off (.). The program always begins with this pattern:

.#.
..#
###
Because the pattern is both 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall, it is said to have a size of 3.

Then, the program repeats the following process:

If the size is evenly divisible by 2, break the pixels up into 2x2 squares, and convert each 2x2 square into a 3x3 square by following the corresponding enhancement rule.
Otherwise, the size is evenly divisible by 3; break the pixels up into 3x3 squares, and convert each 3x3 square into a 4x4 square by following the corresponding enhancement rule.
Because each square of pixels is replaced by a larger one, the image gains pixels and so its size increases.
